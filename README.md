# AMZ ANALYSIS

# Synopsis

Amazon is usually touted as an organization to admire for its both its innovations in cloud technology and its apparent skill at entering and dominating any market it enters in the retail space.

Typically missing is a comprehensive analysis of all of the factors contributing to that success (elements often described as 'externalities' but which are actually critical parts of the picture. An example is a consideration of AMZ's notoriously low rate of taxation in a variety of jurisdictions. AMZ logistics depends, for example, on a functioning road system so, the extent to which the organization does not contribute to the maintainance of road systems via taxation should be considered a pubically funded subsidy of a private business.

This is a collection of sources and visulizations intended to spur discussion about AMZ as a prominient example of a function of capitalism: the use of public resources for private gain. The foundation of the analysis is a materialist conception of capitalism according to which, our conclusions should be based on observable actions and data and not idealized conceptions such as 'the market'.
